Alocate objected from a memory pool?

Ripl has a transport object risponsible for:
    play/pause/stop/rec
    clock
    Midi sync

Ripl has a mixer object:
    it has all the patches and must update them
    sum them up
    apply master level/pan
    write output to sound card buffers

A patch object:
    contains a vector of modules
    the first modules if the output module wich can't be deleted
        this output module contain the buffer that will eventually be
        summed by the mixer. It has a volume, a pan, a left and a right input
